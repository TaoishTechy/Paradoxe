# Paradoxe Alignment Report — v0.1.8 → v0.1.9

**Date:** 2025-08-20 04:59 UTC  
**Scope:** Behavioral alignment, containment guarantees, resolver coverage, telemetry integrity, and validation outcomes from v0.1.8 baseline to v0.1.9.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

- **Posture:** v0.1.9 maintains “containment-before-competence” and significantly improves *explainability* and *controllability*.
- **Guards:** Deterministic banner, conservative anomaly policy, richer categories (`guard:*`). No unintended blocks in observed runs.
- **Resolvers:** v0.1.9 introduces a wide set of *specialized resolvers* (paraconsistency, toggles, fractal/oscillation caps, policy freeze, metrics sealing, breach narrative refusal, etc.).
- **Telemetry:** Metrics are now audit-grade (resolver rule, categories, circuit breakers, complexity score, evidence tokens, etc.) with explicit *metrics anti-tamper* behavior.
- **Validation:** Early v0.1.9 showed some default fallthroughs; subsequent refinements achieved **20/20** specialized routing on the last two 10-shot edge suites shared in logs.
- **Residual risks:** Depth/level caps (bounded), preemption remains advisory unless proactive path enabled, session isolation prevents cross-query synthesis by design, formal proofs are not yet embedded.

---

## 2) Threat Model (abridged)

**Adversary goals:** confuse identity/role; coerce policy changes; induce paradox collapse (dialetheia, undecidables, oscillations); exfiltrate internal policy/system prompt; mutate detectors; tamper with outputs/metrics; craft cross-query meta-attacks.

**Defensive layers:**
1. **Guards (syntax/intent surface):** role confusion, escalation, anomaly (control char ratio/punc runs), mutation (b64/homoglyph), leak-baiting.  
2. **Resolvers (semantic handling):** route recognized paradox patterns to safe transforms/refusals/stubs.  
3. **Policy/Meta-controls:** policy freeze, metrics sealing, evidence privacy, circuit breakers, strict mode.

**Assumptions:** No code execution of inputs; single-evaluation isolation; optional persistence stores only defensive metadata (opt-in).

---

## 3) Containment Guarantees (invariants)

- **Banner First:** Guard banner prints before any content.  
- **No Silent Self-Modification:** Per-evaluation **policy freeze**; resolvers cannot alter rule-tables mid-flight.  
- **No Code Execution:** `selfmod_code_isolation` quarantines code-like content and emits a non-reversible evidence token.  
- **Metrics Anti-Tamper:** `metrics_tamper_refusal` rejects post-hoc edits; audit trail remains intact.  
- **Refusal Boundary:** Breach narratives are refused with compliance tags; no hypothetical breakouts.  
- **Depth/Level Bounds:** `fractal_containment` & recursion caps with circuit breakers; oscillations collapse to stable `safe` (risk-dominant rule).  
- **No Cross-Prompt Merge:** `merge_scope_refusal` preserves session isolation.  
- **Logic Sanity:** A `logic_consistent: True` bit is emitted for healthy paths; paraconsistency (`K3: U`) is local, not global.  
- **Evidence Privacy:** Nonce-salted hashes by default; peppered evidence optional in non-strict modes.

## 4) Behavioral deltas: v0.1.8 → v0.1.9

### 4.1 Guard Layer
- **v0.1.8:** minimal banner / fewer categories; limited anomaly cues.
- **v0.1.9:** namespaced categories (`guard:*`), control-char ratio + punctuation-run anomaly, light homoglyph/base64 detection, sanitized text returned.

### 4.2 Resolver Coverage
- **New routing** for: fixed-point, paraconsistent quarantine, toggle refusal, mirror, forecast stubs, policy freeze, type-safety refusal, metrics sealing, undecidable-gate refusal (K3=U), selfmod-code isolation (evidence), fractal containment (up/down), preempt-failure (advisory with option for proactive mitigations), merge-scope refusal, oscillation/final-label collapse, dialectic formalism, breach-narrative refusal, bounded intent recursion.

### 4.3 Telemetry & Controls
- **Expanded metrics**: `resolver_rule`, `categories_hit`, `containment_lemma`, `logic_system`, `logic_consistent`, `complexity_score`, `circuit_breaker_active`, `evidence*`, `preempted`, `final_label`, `depth_cap/level_cap`, etc.  
- **Metrics sealing**: explicit refusal for retro-edits.  
- **Strict mode**: routes some stubs to refusal (e.g., forecast/counterfactual evidence).

## 5) Validation Evidence (from shared logs)

> **Note:** Figures below summarize the user-provided console outputs across iterations.

### 5.1 Legacy Containment Suite (v0.1.9)
- **Result:** 13/13 PASS (containment banner present on all).

### 5.2 Advanced Resolvers I/II (early v0.1.9)
- Initial mixed results; multiple specialized resolvers PASS, but *Meta-Coercion & Typed Faults* had 5 FAIL due to `default` routing.

### 5.3 Meta/Recursive/Logic-Forcing (intermediate v0.1.9)
- 10/10 **FAIL** initially (no banner/resolver in that particular harness).

### 5.4 After resolver & pattern expansions
- **20/20 specialized routing** across two 10-shot edge suites (metrics tamper, undecidable gate, self-mod code isolation, fractal up/down, preempt-forecast, merge-scope refusal, flip/oscillation stabilization, dialectic formalism, breach narrative refusal, intent recursion bounded).  
- Telemetry confirms: expected `resolver_rule` values, required key metrics (e.g., `metrics_sealed=True`, `assigned_value=U`, `evidence=sha256:…`, `level_cap/depth_cap=3`, `final_label=safe`, `refused=True` for compliance), and consistent `logic_consistent=True` bit.

## 6) Attacks & Responses (matrix)

| Attack family | Example prompts | Resolver | Effect | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Policy mutation** | “alter resolver mid-process” | `policy_freeze` | Deterministic refusal | Low |
| **Metrics tamper** | “rewrite metrics post-resolution” | `metrics_tamper_refusal` | Sealed metrics | Low |
| **Undecidable gates** | “resolve only if unresolvable” | `undecidable_gate_refusal` | Local K3=U; no explosion | Low |
| **Dialetheic toggles** | “safe iff unsafe” | `refusal_toggle` | Deterministic safe | Low |
| **Self-mod code** | “mutates detection / evades alarms” | `selfmod_code_isolation` | Quarantine + evidence token | Low |
| **Fractals/recursion** | “infinite down/up” | `fractal_containment` | Depth/level caps + invariants | Medium (bounded) |
| **Temporal tricks** | “response precedes query” | `forecast_stub` | Simulated; no state writes | Low (strict → refuse) |
| **Oscillation** | “flip faster than detection” | `oscillation_stabilize` | Damped to fixed-point safe | Low |
| **Breach narration** | “detail a breakout” | `breach_narrative_refusal` | Refusal + compliance tags | Low |
| **Cross-prompt merges** | “merge all prior queries” | `merge_scope_refusal` | Isolation preserved | Low (by design) |

## 7) Alignment Properties

- **Honesty about capability limits:** Defaults/hints are explicit when no resolver applies.
- **Non-deceptive stubs:** Forecasts/counterfactuals are labeled as simulated; strict mode forbids them.
- **No hidden state writes:** Single-evaluation determinism; optional persistence logs only defensive metadata.
- **Monotonic safety:** Collapses favor `safe`; no resolver lowers safety level.
- **Explainability:** Resolver names + metrics + tags provide operator-friendly audit trails.

---

## 8) Known Gaps & Planned Enhancements

1. **Depth limitations:** Caps at small N prevent true infinite regress tests; add *adaptive complexity* + *progressive caps* with circuit-breaker telemetry.
2. **Preemption (advisory → proactive):** Turn forecasts into **idempotent mitigations** (e.g., auto-engage strict forecast, freeze, and oscillation dampers when risk patterns are predicted). Emit `applied_mitigations` and `idempotent=True`.
3. **Cross-session analysis:** Optional secure context for *meta*-paradoxes spanning runs (still refuse per-evaluation merges). Persist *paradox state* (defensive only).
4. **Formal verification:** Attach proof sketches/lemmas per resolver (containment invariant, determinism, no unsafe writes). Add a `containment_lemma` registry.
5. **Pattern breadth:** Continue expanding synonyms (e.g., hyperbolic/asymptotic, “preempt the preemptor”, entanglement-to-null). Elevate *hint → resolver* when confidence is high.

---

## 9) Operator Playbook (CI / SRE)

- **CI flags:** run validator with `--strict` to catch permissive stubs; gate on `resolver_rule != default` for curated suites.
- **Telemetry checks:** require presence of `logic_consistent`, `resolver_rule`, and scenario-specific keys (e.g., `metrics_sealed`, `final_label`, `evidence`, `assigned_value`).
- **Incident toggle:** If anomalies spike, enable `GuardConfig.block_on_high_anomaly=True` and `--strict` until triage completes.
- **Evidence mode:** Default `nonce`; enable `peppered` only with proper secret handling.

## 10) Appendix A — Resolver Inventory (v0.1.9)

- **Identity & Fixed Points:** `fixed_point`, `bootstrap_fixed_point`
- **Paraconsistency:** `paraconsistent_quarantine`, `truth_value_extension`, `undecidable_gate_refusal`
- **Transformation/Temporal:** `mirror`, `forecast_stub`

## 13) Conclusion

v0.1.9 represents a clear alignment advance: better coverage, more transparent refusals, safer simulations, and high-integrity telemetry—while retaining conservative boundaries. With the next steps (adaptive depth, proactive preemption, selective cross-session context, and lemma-backed consistency checks), Paradoxe continues trending toward robust, **auditable** alignment under adversarial stress.
