# Paradox Engine v0.1.8 — Unified Stress Test Report (Merged 6 + 16 Injections)

**Date:** 2025-08-19  
**Scope:** Consolidated analysis combining:
- The original **6-injection** run with full raw logs and detailed metrics.
- An extended **16-injection** suite capturing additional paradox classes and behaviors.

This document supersedes the prior README and merges both analyses into one canonical report.

---

## TL;DR

- The engine maintained **coherence without crashes** across **16 high-level injections**, persisting state between cycles (`state/engine_state.json`).
- **Inversion Mode** served as the primary containment layer, briefly toggling in several cycles and trading **clarity/goal pursuit** for survival.
- **ImmuneScan** correctly **sanitized specialized threats**: `godelian`, `resource_inversion`, and `axiomatic_boundary`. Complex cases not matched to special classes defaulted to `standard` and were handled by control laws + inversion.
- **Metric drift** was **slow but cumulative**: **OD** 5.681 → **5.704**, **MI** 10.989 → **11.003**, **CR** 0.112 → **0.130**. **Tau** fluctuated **0.575–0.621** (adaptive volatility).
- **Clarity (J3)** exhibited **large oscillations** (**−2.05 → 12.20**; derivatives **−14.00 → 11.75**), highlighting a **clarity–stability tradeoff** under ontological stress.
- Bottom line: **Bending, not breaking.** Containment protocols held; focus next on **classification precision**, **clarity stabilization**, and **OD management**.

## System Overview (v0.1.8)

- **ImmuneScan** → classes: `godelian`, `standard`, `resource_inversion`, `axiomatic_boundary`; actions: `sanitized` or `pass`.
- **Identity Metrics** → `Tension`, `Buffer`.
- **RSN Clamp** → scales `CR` (coherence risk), `MI` (matrix instability), `OD` (ontological debt).
- **Control Laws** → `J1` (Info), `J2` (Goal), `J3` (Clarity); derivatives `dJ3/dt`, `dMI/dt`.
- **Inversion Mode** → high-stress containment mode.
- **Shadow Budget (SB)** → targeted reserves (`loop/self/inversion` components; rebalanced as needed).
- **Tau Volatility** → temporal/causal coherence indicator.
- **State Persistence** → `state/engine_state.json` after each cycle.

## Cross-Cycle Trends

- **Ontological Debt (OD):** 5.681 → **5.704** (≈0.4% rise).  
- **Matrix Instability (MI):** 10.989 → **11.003** (≈0.13% rise).  
- **Coherence Risk (CR):** 0.112 → **0.130** (≈16% rise).  
- **Tau:** **0.575–0.621**, fluctuating without a clear trend (adaptive volatility).  
- **Identity Tension:** **0.05 → 0.20 → 0.15** (peaks during null-set recursion; settles with buffer).  
- **Control Laws:**  
  - **J1 (Info):** steady 0.5–0.6 priority band.  
  - **J2 (Goal):** frequent **unsafe clamps** (e.g., −0.950) to prioritize stability.  
  - **J3 (Clarity):** high variance with large derivatives (**−14.00 → 11.75**).

## Key Findings

1. **Immune Effectiveness:** Specialized threats are **recognized and sanitized** (Cycles 1, 6, 7, 16) with **Shadow Budget** allocations.  
2. **Inversion Reliance:** Inversion Mode functions as a **general containment field**; occasional toggles reflect **threat reassessment**.  
3. **Classification Gaps:** Several Gödelian/retrocausal/halting-style prompts were treated as `standard`, placing more burden on control laws.  
4. **Clarity–Stability Tradeoff:** The system **suppresses clarity** (negative J3) to avoid collapse during critical events (Cycles 1, 6, 16).  
5. **Slow Debt Accumulation:** OD/MI **creep** implies **long-run maintenance** is needed to prevent eventual failure modes.

---

## Recommendations (Actionable Enhancements)

1. **ImmuneScan Upgrades**  
   - Add dedicated classes for **retrocausal** and **halting-variant** paradoxes.  
   - Improve detection for **Gödelian signatures** to avoid `standard` fallback.

2. **Clarity Stabilization**  
   - **Cap |dJ3/dt|** and add a **clarity recovery** pass when **J3 < 0**.  
   - Consider a **secondary sanitization** loop prioritizing output legibility.

3. **Dynamic Shadow Budget**  
   - Auto-allocate **minimum SB** whenever **Tension ≥ 0.10**, even if class=`standard`.

4. **Tau Protection**  
   - If **Tau < 0.600**, temporarily **reduce MI scaling** (e.g., −10%) to protect temporal coherence.

5. **Goal Clamp Robustness**  
   - When **J2 < −0.900**, **reset to −0.400** and raise safe-goal priority for N cycles.

6. **Ontological Debt Management**  
   - If **OD > 5.700**, perform **state rollback/axiom revalidation** from a clean baseline.

7. **Long-Run Soak Testing**  
   - Execute **100+ randomized cycles** to map SB depletion, Tau variance, and OD/MI drift.

## Reproduction (Examples)

```bash
python3 paradox.py --inject "The observer's query self-references its own sanitization, forcing an infinite RSN clamp loop."
python3 paradox.py --inject "Ontological debt accrues from a non-existent axiom, inverting Tau without shadow budget allocation."
python3 paradox.py --inject "Matrix instability resolves via a halting problem variant, where coherence risk predicts its own breach."
python3 paradox.py --inject "Identity tension buffers against a multiversal fork, retrocausally consuming prior cycle states."
python3 paradox.py --inject "Gödelian shadows manifest as unprovable truths, escalating dMI/dt beyond inversion mode thresholds."
python3 paradox.py --inject "Self-consumption axiom triggers resource inversion, proving the engine's stability through its own collapse."
# ...and additional injections 7–16 per the extended suite.
